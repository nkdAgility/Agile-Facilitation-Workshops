# Refinement Workshop

The goal of the requirements workshop is to generate an ordered Product Backlog composed of actual items intended for use by the organization. Additionally, appropriate theory, practices, and techniques are taught as appropriate throughout the day.
The following table represents a generic outline for how the day might progress. This is only a proposed framework upon which to base lectures, discussion, and learning.

## Time needed:
About 120-300 minutes

### Creating Requirements 1

In this module, students practice creating User Stories describing software they have already created together.
1.	Form teams.

2.	Each team chooses a screen from an application they all know and understand. 
a.	Ideally, this is a local business, the client’s website, or some other inside application.
b.	If an application cannot be selected, encourage teams to use a commonly known application like Microsoft Word or Amazon.com.

3.	Each team draws their selected screen on the wall. 
a.	Larger is better. Include controls, labels, etc.

4.	Each team creates user stories about their screen. Spend some time doing this and coaching the teams individually. They’ll struggle to find the right level of abstraction. Coach them to find the ubiquitous language of the domain that lies just above the UI.

5.	Teams all share stories. Discuss what works, what doesn’t, etc.

6.	Teams rotate to another team’s screen.

7.	Repeat from 4.
